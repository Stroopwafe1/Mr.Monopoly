## Contributing
By all means, please feel free to add to my code. Especially if you want to add your own local monopoly version.
If you do, make sure to make the locale an object with the variable name of its version. Such as 'USDefault' or 'UKDefault' or even 'USLOTR'. So long as it starts with the 2 letters of your region, it's fine.
